# DLPan-Toolbox

### This is a deep learning (DL) toolbox for pansharpening, which can be used for your training anda testing, and easily get the comparison of traditional and DL methdos.



## Introduction
This toolbox mainly contains two parts: one is the pytorch source codes for the eight DL-based methods in the paper (i.e., the folder of "01-DL toolbox (Pytorch)"); the other is the Matlab source codes which could simultaneously evaluate the performance of traditional and DL approaches in a uniformed framework ("02-Test toolbox for traditional and DL (Matlab)"). Please see more details:

- 01-DL toolbox (Pytorch): ``demo_Pleiades_test.m`` for a Pleiades example
- 02-Test toolbox for traditional and DL (Matlab): ``demo_WV3_test.m`` for a WV3 example
